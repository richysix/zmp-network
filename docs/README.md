## Processes

### LOG_INFO

Prints out some information about input files and settings. Only run if
the debug param is greater than 0. Executed locally.

### SUBSET_COUNTS

Creates a sample and count file for each individual experiment with the
counts aggregated to the gene level.

Inputs:

1.  Samples file: Tab-separated file, must contain columns `expt` and
    `sample`

2.  Counts file: Comma-separated file containing counts for all the
    samples (Can be gzipped)

Outputs:

1.  expts_file: File containing expt directory names

2.  sample_files: Tuple of sample files

3.  count_files: Tuple of count files

These are processed to create Tuples containing expt name, sample file
and count file for `CREATE_BASE_NETWORK`.

Script: Runs `subset-by-expt.sh` which in turn runs `subset-by-expt.py`

### CREATE_BASE_NETWORK

Creates a base correlation network containing ALL edges and one with
edge weights converted to absolute values and edges with weights less
than 0.2 discarded. It also removes genes that lead to spurious high
correlations due to large numbers of zeros values.

    gene ids.

    detailing all the edges in the network and their weights.

5.  filtered_tpms_file: Tuple of experiment name and TPM file filtered

    genes where all values are zero removed

    values in 0.1 width bins
